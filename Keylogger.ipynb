    "Introduction:\n",
    "Keystroke logging often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the python pynput package we can implement the keylogger concept. This library allows you to control and monitor input devices, that is how we will be monitoring the keyboard inputs to log the keystrokes."
